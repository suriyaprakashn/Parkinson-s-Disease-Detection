# Parkinson's Disease Detection from Voice Recordings

A machine learning project to detect Parkinson's Disease (PD) from voice recordings using various vocal features and signal processing measurements.

## üìä Project Overview

Parkinson's Disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that significantly affects speech patterns. This project develops a predictive model that can accurately diagnose PD from voice recordings, serving as an effective screening tool before clinical visits.

## üéØ Objective

Build a classification model that can:
- Distinguish between healthy individuals and those with Parkinson's Disease
- Analyze vocal features to identify characteristic patterns of PD
- Provide a non-invasive screening method for early detection

## üìÅ Dataset Information

The dataset contains voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease. Each row corresponds to one of 195 voice recordings from these individuals.
